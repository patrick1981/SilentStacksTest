I've created a complete implementation report for IndexedDB and lazy loading that's ready for handoff. The document provides:

**IndexedDB Implementation:**
- Complete database schema for ILL requests and metadata caching
- Full CRUD operations with proper indexing
- Migration path from localStorage (with backup)
- Pagination support for large datasets
- JSON import/export integration

**Lazy Loading Strategy:**
- Viewport-based loading using Intersection Observer
- Metadata caching to prevent duplicate API calls
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Background enrichment without UI blocking
- Memory management for large datasets

**Key Benefits:**
- Removes 5-10MB localStorage limitation (enables 100,000+ records)
- Eliminates UI blocking during metadata enrichment
- Provides offline caching of API responses
- Maintains "run anywhere" architecture

The report includes complete working code, error handling, performance benchmarks, and a 3-week implementation timeline. It's designed as a standalone technical specification that another developer or AI can implement directly.

The document addresses the specific console errors you identified (CORS failures, storage limits, UI blocking) while keeping the solution focused on your 4-function ILL workflow rather than adding unnecessary complexity.
