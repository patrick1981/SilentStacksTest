**Run date:** 2025-08-11
**Commit/Build:** <!-- agent fills -->

## Summary
- ✅ Completed this run:
  - <!-- feature bullets -->
- ⚠️ Partial:
  - <!-- bullets with notes -->
- ❌ Missing:
  - <!-- bullets with owner/date -->

## Observed Failures vs Expected
- PMID lookup → NCT not populated.
- No field or display for NCT Title.
- No MeSH headings displaying as **selectable** tags.
- CRUD operations (single edit, bulk update/delete) missing if not present → **Baseline regression**.

## Baseline Compliance
- DOM diff vs v1.2 reference: ☐ None / ☐ Differences (attach diff)
- CSS selector compatibility (tablist/panels/inputs/buttons): ☐ OK / ☐ Issues
- CRUD operations from v1.2 preserved: ☐ Pass / ☐ **Fail (regression)**
- Screenshots attached (Dashboard/Add/All/Import-Export/Settings): ☐ Yes / ☐ No
- Theme default = Light; Dark/HC opt-in only: ☐ Verified

## Import/Export Rules
- Bulk paste accepts **PMID/DOI/NCT**, normalizes & dedupes; enrichment applied; CT.gov when NCT present: ☐ Verified
- Table headers **exact**: Urgency | Docline Number | PMID | Citation | Patron Name | Status: ☐ Yes / ☐ No
- Exports: blanks as empty strings (CSV) or empty/omitted (JSON): ☐ Verified

## Security
- Input sanitization (strip HTML/control chars; strict ID regex): ☐ OK / ☐ Missing
- Output escaping (no untrusted innerHTML): ☐ OK / ☐ Missing
- API injection prevention (allow-list params; encoded identifiers): ☐ OK / ☐ Missing

## Operational Safeguards
- Working mode: **PR-only against `main`**.  
- Agent must follow `AGENT_POLICY.md` (in repo root).

## Docs & Comments
- QuickStart / TechMaintenance / DevelopersGuide updated: ☐ Yes / ☐ No
- “What changed in this build” sections appended (dated): ☐ Yes / ☐ No
- JSDoc coverage (exported functions): ☐ OK / ☐ Missing (list)

- Review model: **Self-merge allowed** after checklist and test artifacts.
