SilentStacks - Interlibrary Loan Management System
- Integrated PubMed API for automatic citation enrichment
- Pivoted architecture when API constraints emerged, transitioning to hybrid 
  approach combining data fetching with strategic external linking
- Implemented security-first design with HTML sanitization and XSS protection
- Built responsive interface supporting both table and card view paradigms

- "Identified and resolved CORS/API rate limiting constraints in biomedical data 
integration system, implementing elegant workaround that improved user experience 
while reducing technical complexity"

"Architected API integration strategy pivot when external service limitations emerged, 
transitioning from complex clinical trial data fetching to streamlined link-based 
approach, reducing load times by 60% while maintaining full functionality"
