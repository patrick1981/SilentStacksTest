# GAP Report for SilentStacks v2.0 Development

This report documents the discrepancies between the v2.0 specification (as provided in `SILENTSTACKS_SPEC.md` and the associated playbook) and the current implementation delivered in this iteration.  It is meant to highlight areas where further work is required to achieve full compliance with the spec.

## Completed Tasks

- **Monolith Build:** A new script (`generate_monolith.py`) produces a single‑file monolithic build (`dist/SilentStacks_v2_monolith.html`) by inlining all CSS and JavaScript assets.  This preserves the exact DOM structure of the v1.2 baseline while enabling offline operation.
- **Bulk Import Parsing & PubMed Enrichment:** A new module (`assets/js/v2_features.js`) normalizes bulk identifier input, applies rate limits, fetches metadata from PubMed, and appends new requests to the existing request store.  An event handler is wired to the “Import Pasted Data” button to trigger enrichment and insertion of new records.
- **Documentation Updates:** The `QuickStart.md`, `TechMaintenance.md`, `DevelopersGuide.md`, and `changelog.md` documents each contain a “What changed in this build” section dated August 11 2025 summarising new functionality.
- **No DOM/CSS Drift:** The baseline UI structure (IDs, classes, navigation order, stepper) has been preserved.  Modifications were strictly additive and contained within new JavaScript modules.

## Partial or Missing Features

- **CrossRef & ClinicalTrials.gov Integration:** Only PubMed enrichment has been implemented.  Stubs exist for CrossRef (DOI) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT) lookups, but they currently return no data.  These should be completed to align with the specification’s requirement for multi‑source enrichment.
- **Table Headings & Presentation:** The spec calls for an explicit tabular presentation in the All Requests view with columns: *Urgency | Docline Number | PMID | Citation | Patron Name | Status*.  The current implementation retains the original card‑based layout from v1.2; no table headings have been added.  Future work must adapt the list to render as a table or add a separate table view while maintaining accessibility.
- **MeSH Chips/Cards:** While up to five MeSH terms are retrieved from PubMed, they are currently stored on the request object but not displayed to the user.  The specification requires these to be rendered as chips or cards with accessible labels.
- **Export Enhancements:** Existing export buttons remain unchanged.  The spec calls for enhanced export formats (e.g. CSV, JSON) that reflect the new data model and include enriched metadata.  These exports should also support offline queuing.
- **Offline Queue & Sync:** The codebase continues to rely on the v1.2 offline manager without new logic to queue API requests or synchronize changes when the network is restored.  Implementing a robust offline queue system is necessary to meet the specification.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AAA):** No explicit accessibility audit or adjustments (e.g. ARIA roles for new elements, focus management for new workflows) have been performed for the newly added features.  The new bulk import flow should be reviewed and enhanced to meet AAA requirements.
- **Test & Lint Compliance:** The playbook references tests in `CHECKS.yml` for linting, accessibility, and offline readiness.  These have not yet been run; remaining gaps may be discovered through automated testing.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Complete External API Support:** Implement the `fetchCrossRefRecord()` and `fetchCtGovRecord()` functions and incorporate them into the enrichment pipeline.  Ensure rate limiting and error handling per the spec.
2. **Introduce Tabular All Requests View:** Design and implement an accessible table component within the `all-requests` section that lists requests in the specified column order.  Preserve the ability to search, filter, and sort while adhering to the UI contract.
3. **Render MeSH Chips:** Add UI elements to display retrieved MeSH terms as clickable chips or cards.  Ensure that tooltips or dialogs expose full term descriptions and that keyboard navigation is supported.
4. **Enhance Export & Offline Features:** Update the export routines to include enriched fields and implement offline queueing for both imports and exports.  Review service worker scripts to ensure requests made during offline periods are captured and replayed when connectivity returns.
5. **Accessibility Compliance:** Conduct a thorough audit against WCAG 2.2 AAA for the new features.  Add ARIA labels, roles, and keyboard interaction patterns where necessary.
6. **Run Automated Tests:** Execute the suites defined in `CHECKS.yml` to identify additional gaps.  Address lint warnings, failing tests, and performance issues.

By completing the items above, SilentStacks v2.x will progress toward full alignment with the provided specification.
