## Thoughts as I work this project
---
1. Concurrency is impossible. AI is stateless -- no backup , export method, low overhead make sessions short. WIthout an export function concurrency is an impossibiity.
2. Even with the spin up gates and wind down procedure and performance monitoring, it is still almost impossible. Although this could also be a function of the AI not adhering to CANON like it should.
