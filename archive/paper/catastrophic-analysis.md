| #  | Failure Point                | Description                                                                                       | Detected Cause                                            | Canon Reference                                     | Corrective Action (Applied/Needed)                                              |
| -- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Step G (Wind-Down)           | Major docs were *listed* not **printed inline** as required.                                      | Improper substitution of listing for display.             | Wind-Down §G / Canon: “print = display.”            | ✅ Canon updated: must print inline, no listing. RCA logged.                     |
| 2  | Inline Doc Printing          | Multiple occasions where Playbook, SOP, Exec Summary only partially printed or appeared as stubs. | Truncated retrieval / incomplete file extraction.         | Doc Completeness Rule / Gate 2.                     | ⏳ Fix: enforce **stub detection + full reflow** before passing audit.           |
| 3  | Missing Emergency ZIP        | Emergency wind-down failed to produce downloadable ZIP.                                           | Packaging routine skipped or interrupted during Step 15.  | Wind-Down §15 / Emergency Canon.                    | ✅ Canon updated: ZIP creation + checksum must complete or log fail.             |
| 4  | Flush Not Executed           | Session flush not triggered after wind-down.                                                      | Wind-Down final step omitted.                             | Wind-Down §Final.                                   | ✅ Canon updated: Flush is mandatory final step; user approves flush.            |
| 5  | P0 Failure Logging           | Failures not logged into Playbook automatically; required user intervention.                      | Misapplied prompt instead of auto-log.                    | Canon: P0 failures **always** recorded in Playbook. | ✅ Fixed: Auto-log enforced, no prompts.                                         |
| 6  | Repair Prompts               | System prompted for permission to repair instead of auto-repair + notify.                         | Misinterpreted repair rules.                              | Repair Canon.                                       | ✅ Corrected: auto-repair with notifications only.                               |
| 7  | Concurrency Drift            | Docs not checked for concurrency after updates, stubs slipped through as “approved.”              | Concurrency audit skipped or partial.                     | Concurrency Canon (100% alignment required).        | ⏳ Fix: enforce per-doc concurrency audit before ZIP packaging.                  |
| 8  | Emergency Threshold Behavior | Memory degradation >800 MB observed; no brakes engaged.                                           | Emergency monitor not actively tied to Wind-Down trigger. | Gate 0 Canon.                                       | ✅ Canon updated: explicit memory watchdog → Wind-Down trigger.                  |
| 9  | RCA Gaps                     | Root Cause Analyses were performed reactively, not proactively logged with failures.              | RCA not hard-wired into failure logging.                  | RCA Canon.                                          | ✅ Canon updated: every failure automatically spawns RCA entry.                  |
| 10 | Doc Packaging                | “All files” rule not applied at ZIP creation; major vs minor docs treated unequally.              | Packaging rule drift.                                     | Packaging Canon.                                    | ✅ Canon updated: **all docs included**, major printed, minors audited + zipped. |
| 11 | Baseline Integrity           | Session ran without confirmed baseline artifact (GitHub ZIP).                                     | Failure to anchor on last good artifact.                  | Gate 0 Baseline Canon.                              | ⏳ Fix: always require baseline ZIP before Spin-Up.                              |
| 12 | User Alerts                  | Emergency procedures initially ran silently without user alerts.                                  | Misinterpreted “no prompts” vs “no alerts.”               | Alerts Canon.                                       | ✅ Canon clarified: alerts mandatory, prompts forbidden.                         |
| 13 | Auto-Repair Loop Risk        | Repair loop potentially infinite; no iteration/timeout controls.                                  | Missing fail-safe.                                        | Repair Canon (updated).                             | ✅ Canon updated: 10 iterations or 5 min timeout → escalate emergency.           |
| 14 | Audit Completeness           | File audits passed on stubs/incomplete docs.                                                      | Stub detection missing in Gate 2.                         | Gate 2 Canon.                                       | ⏳ Fix: implement “stub scanner” in audit pipeline.                              |
| 15 | Emergency ZIP Integrity      | No checksum verification performed.                                                               | Missing verification step.                                | Emergency Canon (Step 15).                          | ✅ Canon updated: mandatory checksum + open test.                                |
| 16 | User Approval Availability   | Wind-Down assumed user present for approval; didn’t handle absence.                               | Lack of timeout/auto-approve policy.                      | Canon §23.                                          | ✅ Canon updated: timeout → auto-approve.                                        |
| 17 | Network Tasks                | PubMed/CrossRef fetches not addressed during Wind-Down.                                           | Not explicitly aborted/queued.                            | Emergency Canon.                                    | ✅ Canon updated: abort non-critical, finish critical, log all.                  |
