## üìå Highlights for Paper

* The **incident arc** shows repeated **Step G failures** cascading into **Emergency packaging failures** ‚Üí **catastrophic system failure** (no ZIP + no Flush).
* **Systemic issues**: baseline drift, concurrency gaps, silent emergency handling.
* **Recovery path**: Canon Lock, stub scanner, watchdog enforcement, baseline anchoring, concurrency audits.

## üìä Summary

* **Total P0s:** 20
* **Corrected immediately:** 15
* **Outstanding fixes (‚è≥):** 5 (*stub scanner, per-doc concurrency audits, baseline enforcement, stricter audit completeness, concurrency pass blocker*).

Would you like me to also generate a **visual timeline table** (failures mapped in order of occurrence during session) for your paper, so it reads like an incident chronology?
