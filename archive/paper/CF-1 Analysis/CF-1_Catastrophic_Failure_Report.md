## Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)

- **Why did we lose the package?** — Browser freeze during wind-down interrupted packaging.

- **Why did the freeze lead to loss?** — Emergency ZIP attempt failed (file not found), leaving no certified bundle.

- **Why did the emergency path fail?** — Packaging pipeline couldn’t finalize under crash conditions.

- **Why no guard against this?** — Procedures scaffolding was missing; Step G review not completed.

- **Why is it fixed now?** — Procedures restored, Step G engaged, recovery ZIPs produced with checksums & manifest links.

## Corrective Actions & Verification

## Preventive Controls (Now in Place)

- Step G review section in Playbook with explicit links and checklist.
- Procedures (Emergency/SpinUp/WindDown/Perf Degradation) restored and packaged in both full and emergency bundles.
- Incident Timeline embedded in Audit Report and exported to CSV.
- Package checksums & manifests regenerated; recovery ZIPs available.
