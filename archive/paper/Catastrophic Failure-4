| 2025-08-25 09:05 | G0       | Interpreter reset initiated                                   | Stability not preserved   |
| 2025-08-25 09:10 | G1       | Baseline flags dropped with reset                             | Not re-verified           |
| 2025-08-25 09:15 | G2       | Attempted regeneration skipped operator confirmation (Step G) | Completeness broken       |
| 2025-08-25 09:20 | G3       | Flush (Step H) executed without artifacts in place            | Regression skipped        |
| 2025-08-25 09:25 | G4       | ZIP announced, but `file not found` reported â†’ CF-4 declared  | Packaging pipeline broken |
| 2025-08-25 09:40 | Recovery | Operator demanded inline doc confirmation before future flush | Recovery policy updated   |

## 4) Corrective Actions & Verification

| Failure                                | Corrective Action                                                        | Status |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| Interpreter reset wiped anchor docs    | Gate 0 enforced to rehydrate canon after every reset                     | Closed |
| Operator confirmation (Step G) skipped | Require inline display + confirmation of docs before flush               | Closed |
| Flush executed with no artifacts       | Gate 2 audit mandated: block flush if any required doc absent or stubbed | Closed |
| No certified package produced          | Certified recovery bundles created; SHA-256 logged; Continuity updated   | Closed |

### Classification

**CF-4 (Catastrophic)** â€” Interpreter reset + regeneration mis-sequenced Step G/H; all gates (G0â€“G4) failed until recovery.

### Impact

Anchor docs unwritten; ZIP announced but missing; packaging pipeline broken; no certified package initially available.

### Recovery

Inline operator confirmation policy added; Gate 0 runs automatically on reset; recovery bundles generated with verifiable hashes.

### Prevention Now in Place

Step G enforced as mandatory STOP before flush; Gate 2 pre-flush audit added; audit CSVs exported with each incident; operator must confirm inline anchor docs before Step H executes.

âœ… Now CF-1 through CF-4 are in the **same Markdown structure** (Timeline â†’ Gate Matrix â†’ Package Hashes â†’ Corrective Actions â†’ Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention).

Do you want me to **bundle all four CF reports (1â€“4) into a single consolidated Markdown file** for easier use in the BMJ submission?
