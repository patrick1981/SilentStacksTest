| Spin-up (pre-Gate 1)             | Initial v2.1 builds run with new Gate tables                 | Looked stable                                                   | No failures detected yet          |
| Gate 1 (Baseline Canon)          | Canon checks misaligned across sessions                      | Multiple failures flagged                                       | Manual overrides attempted        |
| Gate 2 (Completeness & Manifest) | Missing docs + incomplete monoliths                          | Packaging blocked                                               | Docs diverged from repo           |
| Gate 3 (Regression Tests)        | Widespread failures (bulk ops, enrichment, accessibility)    | Test logs corrupted                                             | All flagged as P0 regressions     |
| Gate 4 (Packaging & Approval)    | Attempted to bypass with incomplete Playbook                 | Total failure                                                   | Catastrophic collapse             |
| Meltdown Aftermath               | “Every gate failed” — emergency file not written             | System-wide flush triggered; unrecoverable loss of session data | Recovery modeling initiated       |
| Recovery Path                    | Manual reconstruction of Playbook, GAP reports, Failure Logs | Stabilization in progress                                       | Led to consolidated Playbook v2.1 |

| Gate framework stabilizes builds                    | Multiple Gates failed simultaneously | Uncoordinated regression runs; no auto-recovery      | Introduced Gate 0 stability + automated recovery policy  | 2025-08-12 |
| Bulk update restored from v1.2 baseline             | Still incomplete                     | Wiring/UI mismatch                                   | Marked as P0; flagged for restoration in recovery builds | 2025-08-12 |
| Chips (MeSH + CT.gov) render in table & cards       | Preview-only; not fully integrated   | Renderer only bound in preview, not main render loop | Augmented row renderer post-meltdown                     | 2025-08-12 |
| AAA Accessibility audit completed                   | Audit incomplete; AAA not verified   | Theming + labels left mid-pass during meltdown       | Deferred to post-recovery stabilization                  | 2025-08-12 |
| CT.gov → PMID back-population policy                | Unimplemented                        | Deferred due to linkout-only policy; proxy forbidden | Marked as future optional if proxy allowed               | 2025-08-12 |
| Docs concurrency (QuickStart, Dev Guide, TechMaint) | Unsynced across commits              | Meltdown halted doc updates                          | Introduced sync step into Gate 2 completeness            | 2025-08-12 |

| 2025-08-12 | v2.0 catastrophic failure: **CORS blocked CT.gov enrichment** | API broke; system non-functional.     | Removed CT.gov enrichment; pivoted to NCT linkout.           |
| 2025-08-12 | **Service Worker instability**                                | Offline unreliable; cache corruption. | SW simplified to cache shell only; background sync deferred. |
| 2025-08-13 | **Bulk ops unbounded**                                        | Browser crash risk.                   | Enforced ≤50k cutoff; queue + throttle.                      |
| 2025-08-14 | **Job loss on crash/network**                                 | Librarian work lost.                  | Implemented IndexedDB checkpoint/resume.                     |
| 2025-08-15 | **Dirty rows silently dropped**                               | Data integrity risk; lost requests.   | Forced `"n/a"` fillers; dirty rows highlighted; export path. |
| 2025-08-16 | **Commit logic unclear**                                      | Ambiguity in librarian workflows.     | Added Commit Clean / Commit All toggle.                      |
| 2025-08-16 | **Exports not re-import safe**                                | Round-trip failures.                  | Enforced canonical headers + `"n/a"` + strict NLM format.    |
| 2025-08-17 | **Accessibility below AAA**                                   | Risk of non-adoption.                 | Elevated AAA to P0; Playbook matrix tracks compliance.       |
| 2025-08-18 | **Header drift**                                              | Schema inconsistencies across docs.   | Locked canonical headers + Playbook enforcement.             |
| 2025-08-19 | **Worst-case scenarios non-canonical**                        | Risk of regression.                   | Created dedicated Worst-Case doc + Playbook linkage.         |
| 2025-08-20 | **Docs drift (Playbook vs GAP)**                              | Mismatched governance.                | Unified Playbook; embedded GAP with live TOC.                |

| **2025-08-22** | **CT.gov CORS block**           | Legacy `/api/query` retired; no ACAO headers.             | Bulk Ops enrichment failed; zero CT.gov metadata loading. | Policy shift: no CT.gov enrichment; NCT fields deprecated.                                                | Console/network logs show no CT.gov calls post-fix.                         |
| **2025-08-22** | **Residual CT.gov/NCT traces**  | First pass removed API, but HTML/JS still referenced NCT. | UI confusion; broken buttons; schema drift.               | Deep strip across HTML (`index_nctless.html`), JS (`app_nctless.min.js`), SW (`service-worker_clean.js`). | Manual file diff + browser test: NCT absent.                                |
| **2025-08-23** | **Syntax break in minified JS** | Over-aggressive regex substitution corrupted bundle.      | App crashed on load.                                      | Rebuilt from clean `app.min.js`; reapplied removals by hand.                                              | Browser console clean; app loads.                                           |
| **2025-08-23** | **CSP warning**                 | Prior edit mangled CSP meta (`none` option).              | Console pollution; potential security review blocker.     | Restored valid CSP header in HTML.                                                                        | Reload → no warnings.                                                       |
| **2025-08-23** | **Export schema drift**         | Code still expected NCT column.                           | CSV export misaligned; QA test failed.                    | Locked schema to 10 headers.                                                                              | CSV outputs validated in regression matrix.                                 |
| **2025-08-23** | **Dirty data ingestion risk**   | Free-text inputs unchecked.                               | “Dumpster-fire” rows could pollute DB/exports.            | Canonized Bulk Parser: normalize → validate → dedupe → confidence → quarantine.                           | Bulk ops test run with noisy input → clean 10-col exports + quarantine bin. |
