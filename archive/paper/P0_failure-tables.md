| Meltdown Aftermath               | “Every gate failed” — emergency file not written             | System-wide flush triggered; unrecoverable loss of session data | Recovery modeling initiated       |
| Recovery Path                    | Manual reconstruction of Playbook, GAP reports, Failure Logs | Stabilization in progress                                       | Led to consolidated Playbook v2.1 |

| Gate framework stabilizes builds                    | Multiple Gates failed simultaneously | Uncoordinated regression runs; no auto-recovery      | Introduced Gate 0 stability + automated recovery policy  | 2025-08-12 |
| Bulk update restored from v1.2 baseline             | Still incomplete                     | Wiring/UI mismatch                                   | Marked as P0; flagged for restoration in recovery builds | 2025-08-12 |
| Chips (MeSH + CT.gov) render in table & cards       | Preview-only; not fully integrated   | Renderer only bound in preview, not main render loop | Augmented row renderer post-meltdown                     | 2025-08-12 |
| AAA Accessibility audit completed                   | Audit incomplete; AAA not verified   | Theming + labels left mid-pass during meltdown       | Deferred to post-recovery stabilization                  | 2025-08-12 |

| 2025-08-12 | v2.0 catastrophic failure: **CORS blocked CT.gov enrichment** | API broke; system non-functional.     | Removed CT.gov enrichment; pivoted to NCT linkout.           |
| 2025-08-12 | **Service Worker instability**                                | Offline unreliable; cache corruption. | SW simplified to cache shell only; background sync deferred. |
| 2025-08-13 | **Bulk ops unbounded**                                        | Browser crash risk.                   | Enforced ≤50k cutoff; queue + throttle.                      |
| 2025-08-14 | **Job loss on crash/network**                                 | Librarian work lost.                  | Implemented IndexedDB checkpoint/resume.                     |
| 2025-08-15 | **Dirty rows silently dropped**                               | Data integrity risk; lost requests.   | Forced `"n/a"` fillers; dirty rows highlighted; export path. |
| 2025-08-16 | **Commit logic unclear**                                      | Ambiguity in librarian workflows.     | Added Commit Clean / Commit All toggle.                      |
| 2025-08-16 | **Exports not re-import safe**                                | Round-trip failures.                  | Enforced canonical headers + `"n/a"` + strict NLM format.    |
| 2025-08-17 | **Accessibility below AAA**                                   | Risk of non-adoption.                 | Elevated AAA to P0; Playbook matrix tracks compliance.       |
| 2025-08-18 | **Header drift**                                              | Schema inconsistencies across docs.   | Locked canonical headers + Playbook enforcement.             |
| 2025-08-19 | **Worst-case scenarios non-canonical**                        | Risk of regression.                   | Created dedicated Worst-Case doc + Playbook linkage.         |
| 2025-08-20 | **Docs drift (Playbook vs GAP)**                              | Mismatched governance.                | Unified Playbook; embedded GAP with live TOC.                |
