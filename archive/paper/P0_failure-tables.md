## üìå Highlights for Paper

* The **incident arc** shows repeated **Step G failures** cascading into **Emergency packaging failures** ‚Üí **catastrophic system failure** (no ZIP + no Flush).
* **Systemic issues**: baseline drift, concurrency gaps, silent emergency handling.
* **Recovery path**: Canon Lock, stub scanner, watchdog enforcement, baseline anchoring, concurrency audits.
