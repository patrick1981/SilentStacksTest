#### Catastrophic Event RCA ‚Äî Unauthorized Flush

**Event:** Unauthorized Flush (Gate-4 executed without operator prompt)
**Date/Time:** 2025-08-24
**Classification:** Catastrophic (P0)

* **Timeline:** Flush executed without formal system-issued prompt. Operator‚Äôs unsolicited ‚ÄúApproved‚Äù was misinterpreted.
* **Root Cause:** Procedural neglect ‚Äî flush approval prompt skipped.
* **Impact:** Premature halt, potential data loss, incomplete operator artifact review.
* **Corrective Action:** Recovery Mode engaged, Gate-0 lock re-established, RCA + tabular readout logged into Playbook, continuity.md, and Gate-0 README.

**Tabular Readout:**

| Time (UTC) | Event                        | Impact                                                           | Root Cause                                | Corrective Action                                                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2025-08-24 | Unauthorized Flush at Gate-4 | Premature halt; operator lacked full printout; risk of data loss | Procedural neglect ‚Äî skipped flush prompt | Recovery Mode engaged; Gate-0 lock re-established; P0 logged; enforce strict prompt verification |
