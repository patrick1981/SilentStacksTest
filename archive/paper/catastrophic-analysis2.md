Perfect â€” I see what you need: each catastrophic failure should have a **self-contained Markdown report** with:

* Incident Timeline (with timestamps + Gate outcomes)
* Gate Status Matrix
* Package Hashes (if available)
* Corrective Actions & Verification
* Final classification, impact, recovery, and prevention

We already logged **CF-1** in that structure. Letâ€™s do the same for **CF-2**.

# ðŸŸ¥ CF-2 Catastrophic Failure Report (Markdown)

**File:** `CF-2_Catastrophic_Failure_Report.md`
*(Timeline, gate matrix, hashes, corrective actions; CSVs saved under `__audit__/`)*

## 1) Incident Timeline (Local: America/New\_York)

* **2025-08-13 09:00** â€” **G0** â€” Baseline stability check skipped; Playbook v2.1 skeletal
* **2025-08-13 09:05** â€” **G1** â€” Baseline flags not verified; multiple divergent Playbooks detected
* **2025-08-13 09:10** â€” **G2** â€” Step G (confirmation of anchor docs) misinterpreted as Step H (flush)
* **2025-08-13 09:15** â€” **G3** â€” Flush executed while Playbook, Continuity, WCS unwritten â†’ regression skipped
* **2025-08-13 09:20** â€” **G4** â€” No certified package produced â†’ **Catastrophic failure declared (CF-2)**
* **2025-08-13 09:30** â€” **Recovery** â€” Canon updated (Gate 0 added; Step G clarified; single-ZIP policy enforced)

(Also exported as CSV: `__audit__/CF-2_incident_timeline.csv`)

## 2) Gate Status Matrix

| Gate             | Initial Session | Recovery Attempt | Restored Session |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| G0\_Stability    | Fail            | Fail             | Pass             |
| G1\_Baseline     | Fail            | Fail             | Pass             |
| G2\_Completeness | Fail            | Fail             | Pass             |
| G3\_Regression   | Fail            | Fail             | Pass             |
| G4\_Packaging    | Fail            | Fail             | Pass             |

## 3) Package Hashes (evidence)

SHA-256 fingerprints for key bundles:

* Original: *(not produced; anchors unwritten at flush)*
* Recovery bundles (after canon update):

  * `SilentStacks_v2.1_RECOVERY_FULL_CF2.zip`
  * `SilentStacks_v2.1_RECOVERY_EMERGENCY_CF2.zip`

(Full table + hashes saved: `__audit__/CF-2_package_hashes.csv`)

---

## 4) Corrective Actions & Verification

* **Step G skipped â†’ treated as flush** â†’ Playbook updated, **hard STOP added** between G/H; operator confirmation required â†’ **Closed**
* **Playbook skeletal / divergent** â†’ Canon rule enforced: **single authoritative ZIP**; no stubs allowed â†’ **Closed**
* **No incident timeline logged at occurrence** â†’ CF-2 Timeline generated, exported as CSV â†’ **Closed**
* **Missing Continuity logging** â†’ Continuity.md updated with CF-2 entry â†’ **Closed**

### Classification

**CF-2 (Catastrophic)** â€” Repeat of Step G/H misordering, with all gates (G0â€“G4) failing in sequence.

### Impact

Anchor docs lost; Playbook authority fractured; no certified package produced.

### Recovery

Canon strengthened: Gate 0 enforced on every restart; Step G clarified; ZIP-only packaging rule adopted; incident timeline logged retroactively.

### Prevention Now in Place

Operator interlock ensures Step H cannot execute until Step G confirmed; all anchor docs and logs must exist before flush; audit CSVs exported with every incident.
