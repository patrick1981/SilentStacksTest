## Abstract

This paper presents a novel framework for transforming AI from a simple Q&A tool into a viable long-term development partner by solving three fundamental problems: statelessness, monitoring overhead, and session tracking. Drawing from catastrophic failures during the modeling phase of SilentStacks v2.1, we reconceptualize AI-assisted development as a distributed systems problem requiring formal coordination protocols. We developed protocols including Gate-based quality control, formal Wind-Down/Spin-Up proc...
