**Date of Occurrence:** 2025-08-25  
**Phase:** Interpreter restart (session flush)  
**Trigger:** Files not found immediately post-restart; anchor docs unwritten at flush

|:-------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:---------|
| Interpreter restart flushed session memory | Gate 0 mandated on every restart to rehydrate canon | Closed   |
| Anchor docs lost ('files not found')       | P0 ledger, timelines, RCA regenerated immediately   | Closed   |
| Continuity logs absent                     | Continuity.md updated with CF-3 entry               | Closed   |
| No certified bundle produced               | Certified recovery bundles created; SHA-256 logged  | Closed   |

### Classification
**CF-3 (Catastrophic)** â€” Interpreter restart acted as flush; all gates (G0â€“G4) failed until recovery.  

### Impact
Anchor docs and artifacts lost; 'files not found' triggered catastrophic classification; no certified package initially available.  

### Recovery
Artifacts (P0 ledger, timelines, RCA) regenerated; Gate 0 mandated on restart; certified recovery bundles created.  

### Prevention Now in Place
Gate 0 runs automatically on every interpreter restart; operator confirmation enforced before proceeding; audit CSVs exported with each incident.
