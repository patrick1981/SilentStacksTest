# SilentStacks Executive Summary v2.1

---

## Vision
SilentStacks is an **offline-first interlibrary loan management tool** designed to be idiot-proof (ages 8–80), accessible (WCAG 2.2 AAA), and secure against common threats (XSS, API injection).

---

## Mission
- Preserve librarian workflows while modernizing UI.  
- Guarantee access even with no/poor internet.  
- Meet the highest accessibility standard.  
- Operate without server dependencies.

## Advances from v1.2 → v2.1
- **Client-Side Only:** IndexedDB + localStorage storage, zero backend.  
- **Bulk Ops:** Up to 50,000 records; checkpoint + resume.  
- **Accessibility:** AAA baseline integrated; contrast, headings, keyboard nav.  
- **Security:** Sanitization, API encoding, CT.gov API removed.  
- **Exports:** NLM citation, re-import safe.  
- **UI Stability:** No DOM deviation from v1.2.  
- **Worst-Case Scenarios:** Bulk dirty paste, 500k reject, doctor dump normalization.

## Methodology
- Iterative, AI-assisted development.  
- Living documentation (Playbook + Gap Report updated every run).  
- Multi-AI collaboration via Selector Map contract.  
- “Don’t make me think” principle: simplest possible setup and upkeep.

## Outcomes
SilentStacks v2.1 delivers a robust, AAA-compliant, offline-first, librarian-friendly app ready for deployment via GitHub Pages, thumbdrive, or desktop — without coding knowledge.
