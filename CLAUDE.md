# Guidelines For SilentStacks Project

- At least 5 major changes require a version increase (e.g. `1.2`).
- Under 5 major changes require a minor version increase (such as `1.2.1`).
- If giving snippets, also give guidance on placement.
- Regularly review for AAA accessibility compatibility.
- Reserve enough room at the end of chat to provide:
  - Updated Changelog w/versioning
  - Feature Listing
  - Readme
  - Documentation to provide in new chat for seamless continuation.
  
All data will be in `.md` format.
