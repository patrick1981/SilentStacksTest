Preservation Checklist

- [ ] Backup the **four runtime files**.  
- [ ] Bump SW `CACHE_VERSION`; verify old caches are cleared.  
- [ ] Run worst‑case suite; confirm `"n/a"` policy.  
- [ ] Export → re‑import test passes (Clean‑Only and Full).  
- [ ] Attach **GAP REPORT** and **Playbook** to the release.
